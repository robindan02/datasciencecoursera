### Control Panel

The Control Panel on the left allows you to change four variables:

1. The text that will be used to make the predictions.
2. The data model used to make the predictions.
4. The maximum number of words used from the input text to make the predictions.
3. The maximum number of words predicted for each tool.

The Random Word button at the top of the panel will replace the current text entry with a random word chosen from the top 50 most common words in the currently selected data model.

### Tools

Each tab allows you to explore different aspects of the data models:

#####     Next Word

* Displays the next word predicted, based on the current text input, on the bottom-right of the app. A word cloud displays other 
potential predictions.

#####     More Words

* Press the "Next Words" button to rapidly predict a sequence of words. The button can be pressed repeatedly to continue 
predicting words in the sequence.

#####     Word Suggestion

* Displays a list of words with letter groupings that match the last word entered in the text input. Similar to spellcheck or "Did you mean ________?" features.
